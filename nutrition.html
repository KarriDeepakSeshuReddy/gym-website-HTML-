                Introduction:Rule # 1: Pay attention
                You might be surprised how many active adults overlook the importance of nutrition basics — and then run short on key nutrients.
                
                Not getting enough vitamins, minerals and other nutrients can compromise your health and your performance.
                
                Yet fueling up for activity is as easy as following the well-established rules of a healthy diet: Eat plenty of fruits and vegetables, consume lean proteins, eat healthy fats, get your whole-grain carbohydrates, and drink plenty of fluids, especially water.

                    Introduction:Rule # 2: Love carbs (you need them)
                    Carbohydrates get a bad rap with some people. But research over the past 50 years has shown that carbs help your body during long and high-intensity exercise. In fact, the more active you are, the more carbs you need.
                    
                    But what about the trend for athletes to eat high-fat, low-carb diets? Evidence suggests these diets don't boost athletic performance and actually hinder it at higher intensities.
                    
                    During a workout, carbohydrates fuel your brain and muscles.
                    
                    Carbs for the average workout — If you are in good shape and want to fuel a daily, light-intensity workout, eat about 3 to 5 grams of carbohydrates for every kilogram of body weight. For someone who weighs 150 pounds (68 kilograms) that's between 200 and 340 grams a day.
                    Carbs for longer workouts — If you exercise more than an hour a day, you may need 6 to 10 grams of carbs per kilogram of body weight. For a 150-pound person, that's 408 to 680 grams a day. </p>

                Introduction:Rule # 4: Rebuild with protein
                Protein is important because it provides the amino acids your body needs to build and repair muscle.
                
                Most research suggests very active people should eat 1.2 to 2 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight. That means a 150-pound person should eat 82 to 136 grams each day. People who aren't active should eat less protein. Aim for .8 grams per kilogram of body weight each day.
                
                Good sources of protein are poultry (25 grams in 3 ounces) and fish (20 grams in 3 ounces). Those who prefer to avoid meat can try soybeans (20 grams per cup) and legumes like beans, peanuts and chickpeas (about 15 grams per cup). Eggs, Greek yogurt, cheese and tofu are good sources, too. </p>
